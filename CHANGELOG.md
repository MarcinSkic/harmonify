## Multiplayer

![baner](./changelog/5.png)

Game now supports multiplayer gameplay! To achieve this we developed [API service](https://github.com/kaczkadevteam/harmonify-api) and changed most of app logic.

## Music player

App no longer uses Spotify Web Playback SDK (player in browser) to play music, now its based on 30 second MP3 previews. **Thanks to this, a premium account is no longer required to create a room, and room guests don't have to connect to Spotify at all.**
