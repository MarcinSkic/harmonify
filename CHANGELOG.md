# Changelog

## v3.0.0 (2024-05-29)

## Multiplayer

![baner](./changelog/5.png)

Game now supports multiplayer gameplay! To achieve this we developed [API service](https://github.com/kaczkadevteam/harmonify-api) and changed most of app logic.

## Music player

App no longer uses Spotify Web Playback SDK (player in browser) to play music, now its based on 30 second MP3 previews. **Thanks to this, a premium account is no longer required to create a room, and room guests don't have to connect to Spotify at all.**

## Game results

Now, after the game, the user is given list of tracks that were in the game, along with results: whether they guessed correctly, the time it took, or if they did not guess correctly, what mistake they made.

## Round settings

![round settings](./changelog/1.png)

Before the game starts, now you can adjust settings like number of rounds, round duration and track duration.

## Skip button

![alt text](./changelog/3.png)
